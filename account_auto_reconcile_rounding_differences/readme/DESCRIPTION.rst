This module allows you to set a rounding difference amount. Under or equal this difference on payments it will
automatically create a writeoff to the configured writeoff account (and journal if payment is already posted).

On payment wizard it will auto fill the account with the rounding difference account if the difference amount
is under or equal the configured amount
